# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 1st 2023

Basing my journey on Freecodecamp and specifically the new Responsive web design as it is first on the list. https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design 

**Today's Progress**: 
Tasks 1 - 14

I refreshed my knowledge onthe following HTML basics:
Tags,elements, nested elements, images as SRC's, anchors and targets.

**Thoughts:** 

All of this was a refresh of elements covered in the SoC stage 2 tasks - I was suprised at how much I had forgotten.
This really brought it home to me that practice is so important and will hopefully make me perfect!

I really struggled with step 14 but I managed to figure it out and I guess I am going to feel like this a lot!

### Day 2: March 2nd 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
Tasks 15 - 34

Carried out Freecodecamp ‘Responsive Web Design’ Tasks 15 - 34. Learnt about inserting links to a photo and how to improve accessibility of the image added with an alt attribute. Also tackled inserting sections, ordered and unordered lists, figure elements, figure captions and how to emphasize words with a strong element.

**Thoughts:** 

I was very 'cold' at the start and took a while to warm up and recall from task 14, how to insert image links. Practice, practice, practice!

### Day 3: March 3rd 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
Tasks 35 - 46

Today I added a web form to collect information, actions, input elements, type and action attributes, radio buttons and id attributes.

**Thoughts:** 

Will this all stick??!!
Got tied up in knots over capitals and spaces!

### Day 4: March 4th 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
Tasks 47 - 69 

It's Saturday so I decided to do two hours and complete the final steps of the "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App". 
Hey - I am an expert!!!!!!!
No, no not at all. After focsuing on forms for a few sessions, they threw in a request for an anchor element with a link and I thought...yes I know this but how do I construct that again? Yep it had slipped out of the backdoor of my brain. Got there in the end. Then they finished it off with some simple footers and essential title, doctype and meta elements.

**Thoughts:** 

I'm struck by how anxious I feel whenasked to recall something I know I have done but have forgotten the ptecise structure of. So, thoughts like - where do i put that in the syntax. How much of this is memory and how much is it logic and where to look regarding having done something before.
