# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 1st 2023

Basing my journey on Freecodecamp and specifically the new Responsive web design as it is first on the list. https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design 

**Today's Progress**: 
Tasks 1 - 14

I refreshed my knowledge on the following HTML basics:
Tags,elements, nested elements, images as SRC's, anchors and targets.

**Thoughts:** 

All of this was a refresh of elements covered in the SoC stage 2 tasks - I was surprised at how much I had forgotten.
This really brought it home to me that practice is so important and will hopefully make me perfect!

I really struggled with step 14 but I managed to figure it out and I guess I am going to feel like this a lot!

### Day 2: March 2nd 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
Tasks 15 - 34

Carried out Freecodecamp ‘Responsive Web Design’ Tasks 15 - 34. Learnt about inserting links to a photo and how to improve accessibility of the image added with an alt attribute. Also tackled inserting sections, ordered and unordered lists, figure elements, figure captions and how to emphasize words with a strong element.

**Thoughts:** 

I was very 'cold' at the start and took a while to warm up and recall from task 14, how to insert image links. Practice, practice, practice!

### Day 3: March 3rd 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
Tasks 35 - 46

Today I added a web form to collect information, actions, input elements, type and action attributes, radio buttons and id attributes.

**Thoughts:** 

Will this all stick??!!
Got tied up in knots over capitals and spaces!

### Day 4: March 4th 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
Tasks 47 - 69 

It's Saturday so I decided to do two hours and complete the final steps of the "Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App". 
Hey - I am an expert!!!!!!!
No, no not at all. After focusing on forms for a few sessions, they threw in a request for an anchor element with a link and I thought...yes I know this but how do I construct that again? Yep it had slipped out of the backdoor of my brain. Got there in the end. Then they finished it off with some simple footers and essential title, doctype and meta elements.

**Thoughts:** 

I'm struck by how anxious I feel when asked to recall something I know I have done but have forgotten the precise structure of. So, thoughts like - where do I put that in the syntax. How much of this is memory and how much is it logic and where to look regarding having done something before.

### Day 5: March 5th 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
Learn basic CSS by building a cafe menu
Tasks 1 - 20 

Today I covered inline styling, stylesheets and linking a stylesheet and experimented with alignment and background colours (I mean colors!)

**Thoughts:** 

It's Sunday funday! Finally moving on to coffee from cats and designing a coffee menu. Started off easy and then stumped by a couple of recap ideas from HTML stage.

Still making mistakes by using English spelling rather than american.
I LOVE the intro to CSS and find the commands a bit easier than HTML at this early stage of learning.

### Day 6: March 6th 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
Learn basic CSS by building a cafe menu
Tasks 21 - 40 

Today I covered the CSS width (pixels and %'s) property, comments in CSS, class selectors, class attributes, background images, article elements, alignment, 

**Thoughts:** 

Still finding the intro to CSS commands a bit easier than HTML at this early stage of learning.

### Day 7: March 7th 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued with: Learn basic CSS by building a cafe menu
Tasks 41 - 60 

Today started by recapping text widths, then moved on to adding multiple class selectors, the padding properly, max-width property, font-family, fallback values for fonts and font styles

**Thoughts:** 

Still finding the intro to CSS commands a bit easier than HTML at this early stage of learning.

### Day 8: March 8th 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued with: Learn basic CSS by building a cafe menu
Tasks 61 - 82 

Introduced to <hr> and changed line widths. Also beginning to understand when to use a "." (dot) and when not to use a "." when selecting elements / classes to style. Then covered the rainbow of colors for styling <a> link properties (visited, hover, active).

**Thoughts:** 

Found today the easiest day so far!
  
### Day 9: March 9th 2023

**Today's Progress**: 
Finished Learn basic CSS by building a cafe menu
Tasks 83 - 91. This covered margin spaces, refresh of image links, spacing around images and negative margins.

Decided to spend an hour reviewing github basics and a further hour on basic command prompts.

**Thoughts:** 

I found it easier to learn when following freecodecamp lessons than 'just reading'.
  
### Day 10: March 10th 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Dived into the School of Code Stage 2 additional reading and in particular read https://bit.ly/2yoR5T8 This is part 1 of Understanding Git. 
A really helpful explanation.

Today I met up with fellow South Coast bootcampers and all were discussing JavaScript - of which I know nothing!
So I spent the second part of my session doing steps 1-10 (9%) of Basic Javascript. Covered comments, data types, variables, Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another, Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator, Declaring String Variables, Uninitialized Variables, Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables, var and let differences and finally Declaring a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword.

**Thoughts:** 

Cannot wait to do 8 hours or so a day of this!
I loved the intro to JavaScript!
  

### Day 11: March 11th 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Continued with Basic JavaScript, provided by FreeCodeCamp.
Covered:

Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword
Subtract One Number from Another
Multiply Two Numbers
Divide One Number by Another
Increment a Number
Decrement a Number
Create Decimal Numbers
Multiply Two Decimals
Divide one Decimal by Another
Finding a Remainder
Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, 
Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings 
Quoting Strings with Single Quotes 
Escape Sequences in Strings
  
**Thoughts:** 

Wow! All so easy until "Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences"

FirstLine
\SecondLine
ThirdLine

Struggled to get to this:
const myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\n\ThirdLine"; 

### Day 12: March 12th 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Continued with Basic JavaScript, provided by FreeCodeCamp.
Covered:

Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
Constructing Strings with Variables
Appending Variables to Strings
Find the Length of a String

**Thoughts:** 

Shorter session today as I wanted to check that I have everything set up for fist day of School of Code tomorrow, in terms of running latest apps etc 

Day 13: March 13th 2023
Today's Progress:

Long day today - I'm sure I'll get used to this. First day of SoC. Great intro - motivating and excellent introduction.
Wrote up my notes and decided to use my Hour of Code to finish the CSS Diner challenges at https://flukeout.github.io/
In the session today I progressed to level 15 in my pair programming session, so this evening I finished the remaining levels to 32.
I got the hang of it and really enjoyed it - great way to learn.

Thoughts:

Seems that some of the descriptions above are more complicated than the actual commands.
One day at a time and take on board all the good advice given today about the method of learning and the truth about being well outside of my comfort zone!

### Day 14: March 14th 2023
**Today's Progress:**

This felt like another long day today. Second day of SoC. 
We covered more computational thinking, reflective learning, and self-management. All okay I thought and then we tried to solve a scratch challenge.
It was difficult to remember how to solve a simple game based on a user guessing if the next number generated will be more or less than the previous number. There were to be 5 rounds, and the users score would increase or decrease based on whether they guessed correctly or not. My coding team (Lawrence and Lucy) had a good stab but we couldn't quite get there with the loop.

Then this was followed by revisiting Git! If you are reading this then I managed to clone my repository, make changes, and push them back up, rather than simply editing the readme file online!!!!! :grin:

With Git, we looked at the rhythm of changes from starting a new project, making changes (as a team) and pushing / pulling them back down.
I do need much more practice as I am unsure of how branches work and lots of other things. In fact, at this stage I do not even know what I do not know.
I'm pleased if this appears online though :blush:

Tom Burns stayed online after class finished and pointed me in the direction of helpful resources - star! :star2:

Other resources and tools which were new to me today are:
Google Jamboard and Diagrams.net

For the remaining 30 mins of my time, I recapped basic JavaScript functions to help me first thing tomorrow as I believe that is how the day starts - after the squats! :smiley:

**Thoughts:**

Still taking this one day at a time. Hardest thing right now is to not feel overwhelmed and just keep practicing.
Read this online and found mistakes - so had to prove to myself I could amend and upload again - If I can see this line, I did it! :two_hearts:

### Day 15: March 14th 2023
**Today's Progress:**

It was explained to us why we will be focusing on Javascript (as opposed to other possible languages) - whilst it was written in 10 days, it is the current leading language for Web.

Today we covered:
The 5 pillars of learning good JS and how to learn by REPL.

Our main task was to use our newfound JavaScript knowledge to make a secret only available to people who knew the correct password.

We used:

variables
if statements
loops
functions

Then, we declared a function that prompts the user for input - a password. 
We stored that password in a variable within the function
Checked whether the password matched the correct password 
If it did, returned a true from the function.
If it didn't, let them try again.
If they failed three times in a row, it returned a false from the function.

Then:

👉 We Refactored the code into a function called an authenticateUser. This returned a true if the user logged in successfully with the correct password and false if they got the password wrong more than three times. 

I got there in the end (Google was my friend) and I don't know if i could do it again without practising many many times.

I tried to push all my changes to Git Hub - I couldn't see that this worked, but my Visual Code said it worked and my code buddy said he could see the changes. At the moment i am like a rabbit in the headlights with Git.

Other resources and tools which were new to me today are:
https://30secondsofknowledge.com/ - wow - what a cool tool! I've installed this and set it to JS.


**Thoughts:**

HELP!

At the risk of repeating myself. This felt like another (very) long day. Third day of SoC. 

I seem to have moments of eureka, followed by despair.

I've worked out how to add a spell checker extension here, added it and (hopefully) removed my mistakes!
Will I be able to push these changes to GitHub? Let's find out! :grin:
